The iframes of YouTube/Vimeo videos or other external content are replaced by a placeholder. The website visitor has to
click on this placeholder to load the actual content from it's external source. No data is submitted to the external
source before this click. This helps to fully comply with GDPR requirements.

If configured accordingly, this activation can be made permanent and switched off again. The placeholder can be configured
to show individual text, logo and background image or even use it's own FLUID template on a per host basis.
